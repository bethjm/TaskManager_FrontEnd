# TaskManager_FrontEnd

## Initial To-Do Brain Dump

1. **Figure out UX/UI**

   - How to code design...
   - Do I use a framework? Do I use plain CSS?
   - What is the design... Google task managers for inspiration, piece together what I like from each.

   **Page Breakdown:**

- **On Log In**
  show alert of the tasks that are due today in order of urgency

  - **Home Page**

    - Tabs at the top to toggle between tasks and add tasks.
    - Main page showing tasks that should be done for today in order of urgency.

  - **Add Task**

    - Task name
    - Task
    - Due date

  - **View Tasks**
    - List of tasks
    - Ability to check if the task is complete or not
    - Delete tasks
    - Due date
    - Urgency level
    - Maybe create a function to organize by due date?

2. **How to go about coding a full-stack app...**

   - A. Brainstorm everything
   - B. Research UX Design - keep it simple, but add some fun
   - C. Set up the back end first and get that running locally
   - D. Build UX for the front end
   - E. Check for mobile responsiveness
   - F. Set up RESTful routes
   - G. Connect everything on the front end together
   - H. Double-check design
   - I. Deploy back end
   - J. Deploy front end

   **Things to Noodle On:**

   - How to incorporate reusable components
   - How to have the content be dynamic

3. **Front End Tech...**

   - React Router?

4. **Deploying**
   - Back end - deploy to Heroku
   - Front end - deploy to Netlify

other...

maybe for the reminder have the date save in local storage and then have a function that checks the date and if it is not the same as the date in local storage then it will show the reminder.
