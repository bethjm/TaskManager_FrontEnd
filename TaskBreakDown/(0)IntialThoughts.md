# TaskManager_FrontEnd

## Initial To-Do Brain Dump

1. **Figure out UX/UI**

   - How to code design...
   - Do I use a framework? Do I use plain CSS?
   - What is the design... Google task managers for inspiration, piece together what I like from each.

   **Page Breakdown:**

   - **Home Page**

     - Tabs at the top to toggle between tasks and add tasks.
     - Upon login, show tasks that should be done for today in order of urgency.
     - Main page showing tasks.

   - **Add Task**

     - Task name
     - Task
     - Due date

   - **View Tasks**
     - List of tasks
     - Ability to check if the task is complete or not
     - Delete tasks
     - Due date
     - Urgency level
     - Maybe create a function to organize by due date?

2. **How to go about coding a full-stack app...**

   - A. Brainstorm everything
   - B. Research UX Design - keep it simple, but add some fun
   - C. Set up the back end first and get that running locally
   - D. Build UX for the front end
   - E. Check for mobile responsiveness
   - F. Set up RESTful routes
   - G. Connect everything on the front end together
   - H. Double-check design
   - I. Deploy back end
   - J. Deploy front end

   **Things to Noodle On:**

   - How to incorporate reusable components
   - How to have the content be dynamic

3. **Front End Tech...**

   - React Router?

4. **Deploying**
   - Back end - deploy to Heroku
   - Front end - deploy to Netlify
