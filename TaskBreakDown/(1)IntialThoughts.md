# TaskManager_FrontEnd

Inital to do brain dump

1.figure out UX/UI

how to code design...
do I use a frame work? do I use plain css?

what is the design...
google task managers for inspiration, piece together what I like from each

page break down...
-home page
will have tabs at the top to toggle between tasks and add tasks
upon log in show tasks that should be done for today in order of urgency
^have that be the main page

-add task
task name
task
due date

-view tasks
list of tasks
ability to check if the task is complete or not
delete tasks
due date
urgency level

maybe create a function to organize by due date?

2. how to go about coding full stack app...

A. Brainstorm eveything
B. Research UX Design - keep it simple, but add some fun
C. set up back end first and get that running locally
D. build UX for front end
E. check for mobile responsiveness
F. set up RESTful routes
G. connect everything on the front end together
H. double check design
I. deploy back end
J. deploy front end

things to noodle on-
how to incorporate reusable components
how to have the content by dynamic

3. Front end tech...
   React Router?

4. Deploying
   back end- deploy to heroku
   front end- deploy to netlify
